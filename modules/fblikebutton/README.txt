Drupal Facebook Like Button module:
------------------------
Requires - Drupal 8
License - GPL (see LICENSE)


Overview:
--------
Rather than having to manually copy/paste the "Like this on Facebook" code for
each piece of content you (or your users) create, this module will automatically
add that code to the end of each chosen node type. You are able to add a Like
button which likes a given URL (static, e.g. your homepage) or/and put a dynamic
Like button on your page to like the page you are actually visiting.


Features:
---------
The Facebook like button module:

* Adds a like button on your site (static)
* Add more like buttons to your site (dynamic)
* Control the position of the buttons
* Integrates with display suite.
* Overrideable output through templates and preprocess functions.

See instructions in INSTALL.txt


Configuration:
-------------
Go to "Configuration" -> "User Interface" -> "Facebook Like Button Settings" to find
all the configuration options.


Blocks
------------

You can configure blocks with your site or facebook fanpage link
And also add block for determined content types and use "<current>" to establish
the button for nodes.

Responsive
-----------
For this version of the module, we use max-width instead of width in order to have a little more responsive design.


GOOGLE CODE-IN
---------------
This module was ported as a Google Code-In (GCI) 2014 task by the student gvso. Google Code-in is a contest for pre-university students (e.g., high school and secondary school students ages 13-17) with the goal of encouraging young people to participate in open source.
